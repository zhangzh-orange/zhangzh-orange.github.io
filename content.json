In this paper, the author designed a model, ECNet, which combined local evolutionary information with global semantic information to predict protein function. Compared with existing machine learning algorithms, the model showed more accurate results on about 50 deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets and random mutation datasets. Before we get to this article, let me give you some background. The first is directed evolution, which the model hopes to address. As the name suggests, it is a strategy to improve biomolecules towards specific goals. Directed evolution in the lab mimics biological evolution in nature, to obtain more active proteins. The most active mutation in each round will be the starting point of the next round (parental sequence of the next round). The task of computer-assisted directed evolution is to help narrow the range of mutations at each step of the process, thus achieving better results with less cost and time. Therefore, our model must be able to distinguish the quantitative function levels of highly correlated sequences, i.e. in a round of directed evolution, our model needs to predict the protein fitness of a sequence that differs by one or few amino acids from the parent sequence. Deep mutation scanning is a method for simultaneous assessment of fitness for large-scale protein variants using high-throughput DNA sequencing. First of all, we need to construct a protein mutation library, and each genotype is associated with a protein mutation. The fitness of the protein was screened by environment limits. Variants with high activity increase in frequency, whereas variants with low activity decrease in frequency. Finally, the frequency of each mutation before and after culture was measured by high-throughput DNA sequencing technology, to reflect the protein fitness. Reference: Fowler, D., Fields, S. Deep mutational scanning: a new style of protein science. Nat Methods 11, 801–807 (2014). https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3027 The Markov random field is a graph model of joint probability distribution, in which nodes represent random variables, and edges represent the dependencies between random variables. It has three properties, pairwise Markov, local Markov, and global Markov. These three properties are equivalent and can be simply described as: the properties of a node in an undirected graph are only related to its neighbour nodes and have nothing to do with other non-neighboring nodes. As shown in the figure on the right, given the grey nodes, the black node is conditionally independent of all other nodes. In this paper, a simplified form of conditional random field is used, which combines the transfer function and the state function, p (x) is the distribution of the whole random field, and z is the normalization factor to ensure that the sum of the distribution is 1. According to Hammersley-Clifford theorem, this function and the three properties of Markov random fields can be deduced from each other, that is to say, we can use this function to represent Markov random fields. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is the process or the result of sequence alignment of three or more biological sequences. From the MSA, sequence homology and evolutionary relationships can be inferred. In this paper, Markov random fields are used to model the amino acid coevolution relationship of a specific site in a protein sequence. L (e) is the markov random fields’ formula for the probability of generating the protein sequence. The optimization goal is to maximize the function in the current sequence group by adjusting function parameters. To obtain coevolutionary relationships e_ 𝑖 𝑗 based on maximum likelihood. After obtaining the coevolutionary relationship e_ 𝑖 𝑗 of each position in sequence L, it was taken as the representation of protein. The shape is L* (L+1). Due to the varying lengths of proteins and the fact that protein lengths were long but data from the protein Fitness training set was limited, overfitting was easy to occur. So the author used the linear layer of the neural network to reduce its dimension and compress it to a d-dimensional vector as local evolution representation. Before introducing this article’s model, let’s take a quick look at the previous work. Evmutation, DeepSequence and Autoregressive also assumed that there were hidden context relationships in the sequence, rather than only changes in amino acids at mutant sites. Evmutation also used markov random fields to model the hidden relationships of amino acids in the sequence, while DeepSequence used VAE to model the hidden relationships. In regressive model, the goal is to predict the y value corresponding to x, while Autoregressive model is to predict the next x of the current sequence. TAPE pretrained the proteins using methods such as Transfomer, while UniRep modeled the sequences using LSTM. Yang et al.’s model used n-Gram segmentation of protein as input, trained by the DOC2VEC model, and finally obtained the final output by Gaussian process regression. The Envision Model was built on the SGBT model, and the final results were predicted through different feature branches. The importance of various features is shown in the right figure (WT &#x3D; wild type, MT &#x3D; mutant). The above models can either obtain the co-evolution information of proteins through MSA (called local information in this paper), or obtain the semantic information of amino acids in the whole protein through large-scale protein training (called global information in this paper). A reasonable thinking is whether it would be better if we combine them. Therefore, in this paper, local coevolution information and global semantic information are integrated to predict protein fitness. Compared with previous methods, there is some improvement in most data sets. This is the comparison chart with Yang et al. ‘s model and Envision Model. AUROC is used to evaluate the comparison with Envision Model. Then, I want to talk about the whole idea of how this model is built. Mutations in the protein sequence affect fitness in an independent way, called epistasis. In previous studies, it was found that epistasis interactions of protein amino acids could be used to infer protein contact maps and protein structures. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that this epistatic effect could also be used to predict protein fitness. The author used Markov random fields to model the correlation of amino acid residues in the WW domain, and found that the correlation between amino acid residues was related to protein fitness, and the spearman coefficient was 0.35. The correlation was more obvious when the protein had more homologous sequences. The number of homologous sequences directly affects the accuracy of the Markov random field model, that is, the accuracy of prediction of residue correlation, indicating that the correlation between residues is indeed related to protein fitness. The overall model framework is shown in the figure. Firstly, a language model and a direct coupling model are respectively used to extract global semantic features and co-evolution features of local residues. The Language Model is the TAPE pre-training model. The Direct Coupling Model is a Markov random field model. Then, the representations obtained by the two are as the input of the deep learning model. The backbone of the deep learning model is a LSTM and two fully connected layers. The author used grid search to find hyperparameters. In order to improve the robustness and prediction accuracy of the model, three ECNet models are ensemble to get the prediction results. In existing studies, protein FITNESS data of single mutants is more than that of double or high-order mutations, so predicting high-order mutations with low-order mutation data is also a problem that will be encountered in practical applications. The improvement of ECNet in single mutation is obvious, so if the model can be generalized to double mutation and multi-site mutation well? In order to explore this problem, the author designed the following experiments: figure A is, each model used the unit point mutation data as the training set to predict the two-locus mutation; B is the result of using unit point, double and three-site mutations as training set and four-site mutations as test set respectively on the basis of avGFP data. C) is The authors conducted experiments and found that top-ranked mutations of their model(n &#x3D;146) (protein fitness of TEM) were significantly better than randomly generated mutations (n &#x3D; 1460). Since there may be correlations between mutation sites, the authors designed experiments to see if the model could capture epistatic effects between the sites. The authors assumed that epistatic effect was the difference between double-site mutation and dingle-site mutations. they calculated The spearman correlation between the predicted value of the model and epistatic effect, and found that ECNet was superior to Evmutation and was better than TAPE or at least maintained the same. Then the author carried out a real biological experiment to evaluate the effect of the model in practical applications. A is a process for predicting enhanced TEM-1 mutant ampicillin resistance using ECNet. Thirty-seven mutant strains that were different from those in the database and ranked high in the predicted results were screened by ECNet or ECNet ensemble Version. There were only single-site mutations and continuous two-site mutations in the training set, but 2-6 site mutations were included in the 37 predictions. Then, the samples were cultured in the media with different concentrations of ampicillin. Wild Type was used as the relative quantitative standard, i.e. the black dotted line in figure B. The proportion of samples with different genotypes was calculated by high-throughput sequencing. B is the 6 repeated experiments. The mutants screened by ECNet or ECNet Ensemble Version were compared with the previously reported positive mutants, and the results screened by the ensemble model were even better than the positive control on the whole. C is the proportion of protein Fitness higher than the wild type. With the increase of ampicillin concentration, the proportion of protein Fitness higher than the wild type also increased. The predictive performance of ECNet is affected by the characteristics of MSA and DMS data. ECNet works better on proteins with more homologous sequences, more conserved sites within proteins, and on data sets with more complete DMS. Wittmann et al. evaluated the importance of different protein-coding strategies, training strategies, models, and training set design strategies for machine learning-assisted directed evolutionary results and found that the most important consideration was to reduce the “holes” with the lowest information (i.e. protein mutations with zero or very low protein fitness) in the training data. Because there is less useful information to get from such data. Protein fitness actually involves many different tasks, and the characteristics required for different tasks may be different. For specific tasks, we might need to model them respectively, using different features to get better results. This is also mentioned in the ENVISION Model paper. In practice, amino acid residues do not necessarily interact in pairs in space. There may be a larger range of local interactions. It is difficult to model insertion mutations or deletion mutations. Deletion can be modeled as’ gap characters’, but insertion is difficult to model accurately for Markov random fields indexed by position. The author says that insertion and deletion have been mentioned in other works, but the literature cited uses the autoregression method and uses the previous sequence to model the next one, so it has good compatibility for insertion and deletion. There is also a lot to learn from this paper, designing models for application scenarios, such as unit point generalization to multi-site mutation. When patterns of change are hard to see with the naked eye, a statistical assessment may be a good option. Traditional machine learning algorithms tend to have higher interpretability and fewer parameters. When the training set is small and the performance of deep learning method is not good, we can try to apply traditional statistical learning methods, and some important information may be captured.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"MultiDTI","slug":"MultiDTI","date":"2022-09-26T08:04:35.000Z","updated":"2022-09-26T08:43:32.172Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/09/26/MultiDTI/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/09/26/MultiDTI/","excerpt":"","text":"The highlight of this article is the combination of structure-based method and network-based method. The methods of calculating and predicting DTI mainly include similarity-based method and network-based method. Similarity-based methods rely on the assumption that compounds with similar structures may have similar properties. Early similarity based methods mostly used hand-crafted features. In recent years, studies have shown that using end-to-end machine learning models can improve prediction performance. With the increasing number of drug-target data sources, heterogeneous data sources can provide more information and different perspectives for predicting drug-target interactions. The integration of various information from heterogeneous data sources can further improve the accuracy of DTI prediction. However, the structure-based (similarity-based) method and the network-based method respectively have shown shortcomings in the slide. For the problems existing in present methods, this paper gives some solutions: To solve the problem of insufficient length of fixed protein sequence, N-gram coding technology is adopted in this paper, and the length of fixed sequence is set equal to the length of the longest encoded sequence. For the other three problems, the paper uses the joint representation framework to map information from different sources into a common space. This is where the data is obtained, and the interaction network is composed of data from several different sources. This is the pipeline of this paper. Through a joint representation framework, the representations of drugs, targets, side effects and diseases in heterogeneous networks are projected into the common space. Training objective: To minimize all the distances with connection relations in the same vector space Three ways of information aggregation. According to different calculation methods, joint presentation can be divided into three types: The easiest way to achieve this is adding them directly, but most will use a function to transfer it to a new hidden layer rather than using the result of the addition; some literatures also use the multiplication method, using cross product operations on the data representation from different sources; and some works use multi-modal compact bilinear pooling MCB to achieve information fusion. This paper used the addition method. A binary classification task. When tested on the same data set, the results were found to be better than the previous benchmark models, which were all based on interaction networks. However, some structure-based methods also achieve such performance, such as GraphCPI and DeepCPI, so there is a lack of an ablation experiment to verify whether adding interaction network data will have better performance than the model based solely on structure. The prediction result is better when balance the positive and negative samples, but I think the practical application is of little significance. The actual situation is that the negative samples are far larger than the positive samples.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"PPTs of paper reading","slug":"PPTs-of-paper-reading","date":"2022-09-26T07:49:35.000Z","updated":"2022-09-26T09:04:33.834Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/09/26/PPTs-of-paper-reading/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/09/26/PPTs-of-paper-reading/","excerpt":"","text":"The following is my PPT summarizing some papers of my field, you can click the hyperlink to watch: Knowledge graph embedding for DTIs prediction Original article: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz600 MultiDTI: Drug-target interaction prediction based on multi-modal representation learning to bridge the gap between new chemical entities and known heterogeneous network Original article: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab473 ECNet is an evolutionary context-integrated deep learning framework for protein engineering Original article: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25976-8","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Knowledge graph embedding for DTIs prediction","slug":"Knowledge-graph-embedding-for-DTIs-prediction","date":"2022-09-26T02:53:19.000Z","updated":"2022-09-26T07:43:43.546Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/09/26/Knowledge-graph-embedding-for-DTIs-prediction/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/09/26/Knowledge-graph-embedding-for-DTIs-prediction/","excerpt":"","text":"At present, the knowledge graphs used in DTI prediction can be mainly divided into two categories, one is bipartite graph, the other is heterogeneous graph. Bipartite graph only has the relationship information between drug and target; while heterogeneous graph adds more auxiliary information for prediction, but it’s more difficult to find proper methods to embed the heterogeneous graph. As is shown in the picture on the left, it is difficult for us to know the meaning of a strange word. However, by referring to the picture, we can understand that the word is the name of a football player and has been used to advertise a certain product. “Knowledge” can be formed by making connections between entities like this, and such relationships are the basic form of a knowledge graph. A true knowledge graph consists of pieces of knowledge, each of which is represented as an SPO triplet. This is a table of the datasets and relationship types used in this article. TransE cannot cover a relationship that is not 1-to-1 as it learns only one aspect of similarity. For example, the relationship of locations, Beijing (A) is located in China (B), Shanghai (C) is located in China (B) too, the same relationship connects different entities. TransH give the solution of such problems, as long as finding a hyperplane, which projections of (A, B) and (C, B) on it are the same. The scoring function of most KGE algorithms can be reduced to a combination of bilinear mapping and linear mapping. TransE performance can also be achieved by using bilinear mapping results for simple values. A linear map L:V→W is a function that take a vector and gives a vector :L(→v)&#x3D;→w. (and is linear: L(a→x+b→y)&#x3D;aL(→x)+bL(→y)) A bilinear map B:V1×V2→W take two vectors ( a couple in the cartesian product) and gives a vector: B(→v1,→v2)&#x3D;→w.

The bibliography is the fifth edition of Biostatistics edited by Chunxi Li, and the completed code is shared here. Chapter 4 Statistical inferenceStatistical inference is a method of making decisions about the parameters of a population, based on random sampling. 4.1 Hypothesis testing4.1.1 Steps of hypothesis testing4 steps of hypothesis testing: State the hypotheses (null hypothesis H0 and alternative hypothesis HA). Deciding significance level and test method (often choose significance levels &#x3D; 0.01 or 0.05). Calculating test statistic and P-value. The P-value is the probability of observing a sample statistic as extreme as the test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Whether to reject the null hypothesis. 4.1.2 Two-Tailed vs. One-Tailed TestTwo-tailed test: critical area of a distribution is two-sided whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values One-tailed test: critical area of a distribution is one-sided either greater than or less than a certain value, but not both According to the testing requirements and professional knowledge, using one-tailed test as far as possible to improve the sensitivity of hypothesis testing. 4.1.3 Type I &amp; Type II ErrorsType I error is a false positive conclusion； Type II error is a false negative conclusion. Example: Type I vs Type II error You decide to get tested for COVID-19 based on mild symptoms. There are two errors that could potentially occur: Type I error (false positive): the test result says you have coronavirus, but you actually don’t. Type II error (false negative): the test result says you don’t have coronavirus, but you actually do. Null hypothesis is… TRUE FALSE Rejected Type I errorFalse positiveProbability &#x3D; α Correct decisionTrue positiveProbability &#x3D; 1-β Not rejected Correct decisionTrue negativeProbability &#x3D; 1-α Type I errorFalse negativeProbability &#x3D; β Reducing the alpha always comes at the cost of increasing beta, and vice versa. The null hypothesis distribution shows all possible results you’d obtain if the null hypothesis is true. The correct conclusion for any point on this distribution means not rejecting the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis distribution shows all possible results you’d obtain if the alternative hypothesis is true. The correct conclusion for any point on this distribution means rejecting the null hypothesis. 4.2 Hypothesis Test for Mean4.2.1 Hypothesis Test for a Mean The population variance σ2 is known When the population variance σ2 is known, no matter whether the sample is large (n&gt;&#x3D;30) or small (n&lt;30), the distribution of sample mean follows the normal distribution, and after standardization, it follows the standard normal distribution, namely the U distribution. Therefore, the u-test method was used to test the hypothesis. Example: The average body length and standard deviation of silver carp larvae raised by conventional methods in a fishery at 1 month old were 7.25cm and 1.58 cm, respectively. In order to improve the quality of larvae, a new method was adopted to raise the larvae. 100 larvae were randomly selected at the age of 1 month, and the average body length was 7.65cm. Is there any significant difference in body length between the new method and the conventional method at 1 month of age? 1234567891011121314151617181920# Method 1: Generate a batch of data conforming to the original parameters and perform a non-parametric test on the datanew_method &lt;- rnorm(100,mean = 7.65,sd = 1.58)# dnorm: normally distributed probability density function# pnorm: returns the integral from minus infinity to q, pnorm(0) = 0.5# qnorm: inverse function of pnorm# rnomr: Generate a set of random numbers according to normal distribution# Z-test on generated data# H0:μ = μ0 = 7.25, HA：μ ≠ μ0library(BSDA)z.test(x = new_method, # Samples are the generated data alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, # two-sided test mu = 7.25, # mean of the population = 7.25 sigma.x = 1.58) # population standard deviation# Here, because the data is randomly generated and normally distributed, the results may not be the same each time# My result: z = 2.2647, p-value = 0.02353 &lt; 0.05.# Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative hypothesis was accepted. The new method was different from the conventional method.# Because the mean value was greater than the population mean, the new method was significantly longer than the conventional method. My result: A z-test is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large. A z-test is a hypothesis test in which the z-statistic follows a normal distribution. A z-statistic, or z-score, is a number representing the result from the z-test. 1234567891011# Method 2: Calculating atep by step (u-test)x_bar &lt;- 7.65 # mean of samples = 7.65n &lt;- 100 # sample size = 100sigma &lt;- 1.58 # population standard deviation = 1.58miu &lt;- 7.25 # population mean = 7.25sigma_x_bar &lt;- sigma/sqrt(n) # calculate the sample standard deviationu &lt;- (x_bar - miu)/sigma_x_bar # convert to a standard normal distribution valueu # u = 2.531646u_0.05 &lt;- qnorm(0.975) # the right rejection region, two-sided testu_0.05 # u_0.05 = 1.959964# Thus u &gt; u_0.05, that is p &lt; 0.05，the new method was significantly longer than the conventional method. Example: We know that the average weight of a certain corn is 300g, standard deviation 9.5g. After spraying a plant growth regulator, randomly selected 9 ears of corn, the weights were 308, 305, 311, 298, 315, 300, 321, 294, 320 (g) respectively. Is there any effect of this regulator on ear weight? 12345678910111213weight &lt;- c(308,305,311,298,315,300,321,294,320)miu0 &lt;- 300 # the mean of corn earssigma &lt;- 9.5 # standard deviation# Z test# H0: μ = μ0 = 300, HA：μ ≠ μ0library(BSDA)z.test(x = weight, # Samples are the generated data alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;, # two-sided test mu = miu0, # mean of the population sigma.x = sigma) # population standard deviation# z = 2.5263，p-value = 0.01153 &lt; 0.05, # The null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative hypothesis was accepted, and the mean of samples is larger than population mean, suggesting that spraying regulator could significantly increase ear weight of corn. The population variance σ2 is unknown When the population variance σ2 is unknown, as long as the sample size is n &gt;&#x3D; 30. According to the central limit theorem, the distribution of sample means approximately normal distribution. Therefore, the sample variance s2 can be used to estimate the population variance σ2, and the u test method is still used. Example: For the production of certain textiles, the average length of the cotton fibers needs to be more than 30 mm. The average length and standard deviation of a cotton variety with n&#x3D;400 were 30.2 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively. Is the fiber length of the cotton variety sufficient to produce textile production? 1 4.2.2 Hypothesis test for difference between two means The population variances σ12 and σ22 are known When the population variances σ12 and σ22 are known, no matter whether the sample is large (n&gt;&#x3D;30) or small (n&lt;30), the distributions of sample means follow the normal distribution. The u-test method was used to test the hypothesis. The population variances σ12 and σ22 are unknown n1 &gt;&#x3D; 30 and n2 &gt;&#x3D; 30, using u test (or z test). Example: 55 strains and 107 strains of the two rubber varieties were randomly sampled for cutting, the average yield of cutting was 95.4 mL&#x2F; plant and 77.6 mL&#x2F; plant, and the variance of cutting yield was 936.36 (mL&#x2F; plant)2 and 800.89 (mL&#x2F; plant)2, respectively. To test whether there is a significant difference in cutting yield between the two rubber varieties. 1234567891011121314151617# We don&#x27;t know which one has higher yield, because we don&#x27;t know their population mean.

When two population variances σ12 and σ22 are unknown, and n1 or n2 &lt; 30 are less than 30, the mean difference no longer follows a normal distribution, but follows a t-distribution, so the two-sample t-test is used. Example: One-month-old rats were fed with high-protein and low-protein diets. After 3 months, the weight gain (g) of rats in the two groups was measured. The data of the two groups were respectively: High protein group: 134,146,106,119,124,161,107,83,113,129,97,123; Low protein group: 70,118,101,85,107,132,94.
