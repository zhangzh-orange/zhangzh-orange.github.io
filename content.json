I am interested in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, which is consistent with my graduate program. In terms of application, I am most interested in protein structure and function, -omics data analysis and drug-protein interaction prediction; in terms of technology, I think graph neural network and knowledge graph are very promising. EducationUniversity of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2020.9-2023.6), Shanghai, China Master of Drug Design Science (Supervisors: Prof. Jiang Hualiang and Prof. Mingyue Zheng) Focus on computer aided drug design, especially artificial intelligent drug design. Chang Gung University (2018.6-2018.9), Taiwan, China Exchange programme (Supervisor Assoc. Prof. Yi-Ting Chen) Concentration in Biological Mass Spectrometry. Learning the knowledge about LC–MS proteomic technique, and analyzing proteome of urine samples from renal cancer patient. Xiamen University (2016.9-2020.6), Xiamen, China Bachelor of Biochemistry and Biotechnology (Supervisor: Prof. Xianming Deng) Selected for “Mount Everest Plan” (a programme of China, offering special classes in fundamental sciences for the Chinese top students) and “the Beutler institute“ (an institute established by several top universities in China, committed to the cultivation of outstanding talents in the field of life sciences). Learning the basics of biological science extensively and having research experience in several different sub-disciplines (natural product drug discovery, algology and cancer biology in Prof. Xianming Deng’s, Assoc. Prof. Hong Xu’s and Prof. Dawang Zhou’s labs, respectively). Skills Programming Language: Python (main for machine learning and deep learning), R (main for biostatistics), Visual Basic Neural network models: CNN, GNN, Transformer, RNN, etc Machine learning models: Random Forest, Supprt Vector Model, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc. Python packages: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, PyG, BioPython, RDKit, etc. Molecular docking: Schrödinger, PyMOL Protein crystal structure determination: molecular replacement, model building and refine with Phenix and CCP4 Others: MestReNova for NMR spectroscopy analysis, SPSS for biostatistical analysis Projects and publications A review about protein-drug interaction prediction (published, first author) Zhang, Z., Chen, L., Zhong, F., Wang, D., Jiang, J., Zhang, S., Jiang, H., Zheng, M. and Li, X., 2022. Graph neural network approaches for drug-target interactions. Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 73, p.102327. Using machine learning models predict nanocarriers’ transfection efficiency (submitted, co-first author) We collected two datasets from previous publications and used them to predict the transfection efficiency of nanocarriers, with four machine learning models (SVC, RF, LightGBM and XGBoost). And we used these models to find several high transfection efficiency nanocarriers, with experimental verification. GNN for Protein function prediction and directed evolution (waiting for experiment results) We designed a new deep-learning algorithm based on GNN to predict functional fitness for protein engineering, which outperforms the previous models (DeepSequence, EVmutation, ECNet, and etc.) on most datasets. Now we are waiting for experimental data from cooperators to test our model. Antigen-antibody affinity prediction competition This task is to predict the affinity of antibody-antigen binding based on the amino acid sequence of antigen and antibody. I finished 12th out of 236 teams in the competition. (Team Name: 违规昵称Q98X72) Media platform I set up a official account in WeChat for my research group, which now have about 1600 followers. I also have my own official account (just like a blog, around 900 followers), where I publish my reading notes, some of which were translated into English to my blog. As a reviewer Now I am a reviewer of Artificial Intelligence in the Life Sciences. I have reviewed 4 articles with Prof. Mingyue Zheng (1 of Briefings in Bioinformatics, 1 of Bioengineering &amp; Translational Medicine, and 2 of Artificial Intelligence in the Life Sciences). Participated in the writing of two books Chapter 23 of《高等药物化学》（第二版）(Advanced pharmaceutical chemistry, second edition). I wrote the section about machine learning in drug repurposing. This book is not yet published, but the first edition is available (ISBN：9787122104090). 《人工智能与药物设计》(Artificial intelligence for drug design). I co-wrote the section about artificial intelligent for drug toxicity prediction, including liver toxicity, dermal toxicity, and mutagenesis.
